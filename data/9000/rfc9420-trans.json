Establishing keys to provide such protections is challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two clients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same time.

For two parties, this problem has been studied thoroughly, with the Double Ratchet emerging as a common solution [DoubleRatchet] [Signal].

      "text": "For a group of size greater than two, a common strategy is to distribute symmetric \"sender keys\" over existing 1:1 secure channels, and then for each member to send messages to the group encrypted with their own sender key. On the one hand, using sender keys improves efficiency relative to pairwise transmission of individual messages, and it provides forward secrecy (with the addition of a hash ratchet). On the other hand, it is difficult to achieve post-compromise security with sender keys, requiring a number of key update messages that scales as the square of the group size. An adversary who learns a sender key can often indefinitely and passively eavesdrop on that member's messages. Generating and distributing a new sender key provides a form of post-compromise security with regard to that sender. However, it requires computation and communications resources that scale linearly with the size of the group.",

This ability is sufficient to allow the AS to join new groups as if it were that user. Depending on the application architecture, it may also be sufficient to allow the compromised AS to join the group as an existing user, for instance, as if it were a new device associated with the same user. If the application uses a transparency mechanism such as CONIKS [CONIKS] or Key Transparency [KT], then it may be possible for end users to detect this kind of misbehavior by the AS. It is also possible to construct schemes in which the various clients owned by a user vouch for each other, e.g., by signing each others' keys.",

In such a case, the Commit will be accepted by the group, and the resulting state will possibly be used as the basis for further Commits.
